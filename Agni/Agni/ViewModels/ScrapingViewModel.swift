/// handling both quick scrapes and batch processing tasks. It maintains the state of ongoing
/// operations and provides methods to initiate and control scraping tasks.

/// Use this view model to:
/// - Perform quick scraping of individual URLs
/// - Manage batch scraping operations
/// - Track scraping progress and status
/// - Handle scraping results and errors
