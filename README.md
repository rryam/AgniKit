# AgniKit: Unofficial Swift SDK for Firecrawl üî•

AgniKit is the unofficial Swift SDK for the Firecrawl API. It provides a simple way to integrate Firecrawl's web scraping and crawling capabilities into your Swift projects for prototyping and development.

Agni (‡§Ö‡§ó‡•ç‡§®‡§ø) is the Sanskrit word for "fire", which aligns with the "fire" theme of Firecrawl. In Hindu mythology, Agni is also the god of fire, representing power and purification.

## Features

- One line Swift APIs for Firecrawl API
- Support for scraping, crawling, and data extraction
- Swift concurrency

## Installation

Add the following to your `Package.swift` file:

```swift
dependencies: [
    .package(url: "https://github.com/rryam/AgniKit.git", from: "1.0.0")
]
```

## Quick Start

```swift
import AgniKit

let agniKit = AgniKit(apiKey: "your-api-key")

do {
    let result = try await agniKit.scrape(url: "https://example.com")
    print(result.markdown)
} catch {
    print("Error: \(error)")
}
```

AgniKit is not officially associated with Firecrawl. It is aimed for me to learn about its APIs and provide Swift developers easy access to Firecrawl's capabilities.
