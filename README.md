# **AgniKit: Unofficial Swift SDK for Firecrawl üî•**

AgniKit is the unofficial Swift SDK for the [Firecrawl](https://www.firecrawl.dev) API. It provides a simple way to integrate Firecrawl's web scraping and crawling capabilities into your Swift projects for prototyping and development.

Agni (‡§Ö‡§ó‡•ç‡§®‡§ø) is the Sanskrit word for "fire", which aligns with the "fire" theme of Firecrawl. In Hindu mythology, Agni is also the god of fire, representing power and purification.

## **Quickstart**

Find the quickstart of Firecrawl here: [Quickstart](https://docs.firecrawl.dev/introduction)

## **Features**

- One line Swift APIs for Firecrawl API
- Support for scraping, crawling, and data extraction
- Swift concurrency

## **Installation**

Add the following to your `Package.swift` file:

```swift
dependencies: [
    .package(url: "https://github.com/rryam/AgniKit.git", from: "1.0.0")
]
```

## **Quick Start**

```swift
import AgniKit

let agniKit = AgniKit(apiKey: "your-api-key")

do {
    let result = try await agniKit.scrape(url: "https://example.com")
    print(result)
} catch {
    print("Error: \(error)")
}
```

## **Examples**

### Scraping a webpage

```swift
let result = try await agniKit.scrape(
    url: "https://example.com",
    formats: ["markdown", "html"],
    onlyMainContent: true,
    includeTags: ["p", "h1", "h2"],
    excludeTags: ["script", "style"],
    timeout: 60000
)
print(result)
```

### Crawling a website

```swift
let crawlJob = try await agniKit.crawl(
    url: "https://example.com",
    maxDepth: 3,
    limit: 100,
    allowExternalLinks: false,
    scrapeOptions: ["formats": ["markdown"]]
)
print("Crawl job started: \(crawlJob)")

// Check crawl status
let status = try await agniKit.getCrawlStatus(id: crawlJob["id"] as! String)
print("Crawl status: \(status)")
```

### Mapping a website

```swift
let mapResult = try await agniKit.map(
    url: "https://example.com",
    search: "product",
    includeSubdomains: true,
    limit: 1000
)
print("Mapped links: \(mapResult["links"] as! [String])")
```

### Canceling a crawl job

```swift
let cancelResult = try await agniKit.cancelCrawl(id: "crawl-job-id")
print("Crawl job canceled: \(cancelResult)")
```

AgniKit is not officially associated with Firecrawl. It is aimed for me to learn about its APIs and provide Swift developers easy access to Firecrawl's capabilities.
